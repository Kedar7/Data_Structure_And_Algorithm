Everyone in this video to talk about the order of the content is arranged in.

00:04.680 --> 00:09.420
So we've established that there is a lot of stuff here and it's pretty varied.

00:09.420 --> 00:14.460
You don't have to go through every single video one after the other like you might with the intro to

00:14.550 --> 00:16.340
C S S course or intro to J.

00:16.330 --> 00:22.350
Yes some of you might be here only for the sorting algorithm stuff or only the data structures and that's

00:22.350 --> 00:23.880
totally fine.

00:23.910 --> 00:26.360
You do not need to go through everything in order.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.410
But however you do it please take your time.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.330
This content can be a little dense.

00:31.350 --> 00:32.770
There's a lot of it here.

00:32.790 --> 00:39.270
Remember that this is the condensed version of what I teach over two and a half three weeks of in-person

00:39.270 --> 00:43.600
courses in a boot camp where it's five days a week eight to 10 hours a day.

00:43.620 --> 00:46.820
It's very intense content and this is three weeks of that.

00:46.830 --> 00:51.910
So even though it might it's only 20 something hours remember that that's just the amount of lecture.

00:51.930 --> 00:56.580
There's a lot of time to digest that and understand it do the quizzes build stuff etc..

00:57.000 --> 01:03.340
So onto the important piece which is please notice the prerequisite lectures in every section.

01:03.360 --> 01:10.590
After the first section and the next section every other section contains at the very beginning a lecture

01:10.740 --> 01:19.830
may just show you here called prerequisites in all caps and all that it contains is information about

01:20.070 --> 01:22.050
which other sections you need to complete.

01:22.050 --> 01:24.040
First before you can tackle this one.

01:24.120 --> 01:30.080
So if you do want to jump to sorting algorithms for example I'd say you want to go to a bubble sort.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.230
Well all that you really need to know.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.500
According to this is Big O notation.

01:34.500 --> 01:39.780
Section 1 if you want to jump to a more complex sorting algorithm like merge sort.

01:40.110 --> 01:45.720
You definitely need to know Big-O notation and Section 6 which covers recursion because merge sort the

01:45.720 --> 01:48.890
way we implement it is with a recursive implementation.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.750
And then there are some secondary considerations.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.930
These are the sections I recommend you check out but you don't have to.

01:55.980 --> 01:59.830
So the first to hear Section 1 in section 6.

01:59.850 --> 02:05.160
You definitely need to understand these are just helpful and you can see as we go later in the course

02:05.160 --> 02:08.410
like we look at binary search trees.

02:08.550 --> 02:09.280
Same thing.

02:09.490 --> 02:14.220
The prerequisites that you definitely need to understand and then things that could be helpful while

02:14.220 --> 02:17.550
not could be things that will be helpful but they're not mandatory.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.040
So please pay attention to that.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.070
Every section has prerequisites.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.440
A text lecture at the beginning.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.710
It's there for a reason.

02:23.730 --> 02:28.410
If you do hop around if you don't want to go through every single section in order make sure you're

02:28.410 --> 02:33.810
paying attention to that so that you don't get confused when I talk about binary heaps and priority

02:33.810 --> 02:39.990
queues in the dextrous shortest path section which if we go to that section you can see here we are.

02:39.990 --> 02:43.320
You can see you need to have binary heaps and priority queues.

02:43.470 --> 02:45.060
Anyway I'll leave it at that.

02:45.090 --> 02:48.110
Just please notice those prerequisites lectures are very helpful.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.040
If you do want to hop around Otherwise you can just go to the content in order.

02:52.140 --> 02:52.340
Get.
