00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,110
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,050
In this video I want to address my developer environment.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,120
I'm keeping things really really simple for this course.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,170
I'm not even having I'm not downloading any software.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm doing everything in the browser.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,170
That doesn't mean that you need to do that at this point.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,430
The only requirement for the course is that you know the basic syntax javascript.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,200
You know that you're comfortable writing J.S. code.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,240
So however you do that up until now.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,740
I would just do that continue on but I want to show you what I'm going to do if you do want to follow

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,330
along.

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,170
So I'm using Chrome as my browser.

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,870
I always do in all my courses and chrome comes with a little developer tool called snippets javascript

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,010
snippets.

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,450
So here's chrome and I just open up the con..

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,170
I usually use a shortcut on a Mac it's command shift or no it command option J but you can also go to

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,760
inspect and then that takes you to the elements and you can go over to the sources tab and then in the

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,810
sources tab there's a snippets sub tab I guess you would call it.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,760
There's a couple of them but I have snippets as the only thing that shows and you can see I have a bunch

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,430
of names snippets I've I'm recording this after I finished writing and recording the rest of the course.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,940
So you can see for example here's one of our snippets.

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,710
So I'm just doing everything in the browser here rather than using the terminal and running code with

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,520
no G-S.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,080
You absolutely could do that.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,970
You could write your code and Sublime Text.

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,720
You could use.

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,820
I think there's equivalents to snippets and other browsers you could use Jay Espen code pen there's

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,570
many options out there just run javascript but to show you how this works.

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,680
Let's say I'm going to make a new empty snippet.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,700
You've seen me do this a couple of times in the course.

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:48,060
I'll just call this demo snippet and then in here close that I'll make it a little larger and then just

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,950
do some really simple thing like concept about log Hello from.

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,660
From this snippet.

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,050
Oh my gosh can not spell here.

35
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:57,850
OK.

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,850
So let's leave it at that.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,250
And all I have to do is to execute this code is either go down here and click play.

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,290
But also it shows me the shortcut command return on a Mac and on the PC will tell you whatever the respective

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,400
equivalent is.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,660
So when I hit that I'm going to do it right now if I scroll up I should see.

41
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,160
There we go.

42
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,760
Hello from the snippet.

43
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,980
So you'll see me do this throughout the course.

44
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,580
For example I might run this snippet here and it doesn't matter what it does it's a binary search tree

45
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,280
breath first search hit command enter.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,200
It just ran.

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,580
And you can see this is the output.

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,140
This is what was returned.

49
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,630
And that's pretty much all I have to say about Crumb's.

50
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,530
Tippett So you'll see me work with them frequently.

51
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,280
I just have a bunch of them over here.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,890
I usually make a new one for each thing so here's a double length list.

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,030
We add a set method and then I'll make a new one when we add a remove method for example.

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,660
But that's all I'll say for now.

55
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,880
It's a very easy way for me to run code in the browser that everyone can do.

56
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,260
You don't have to download anything that's not Mac or PC specific but also if you know how to write

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,370
javascript which I hope you do to take this course should know the basics.

58
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,520
You might just want to continue on with whatever you're most comfortable with.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,820
This is not a requirement for the course.

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,610
We're writing basic javascript.

61
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,850
Run it however you prefer.

62
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,470
OK.
