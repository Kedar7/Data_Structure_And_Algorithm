1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,310
OK so this will be really quick video but I want to show something.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,930
I'm kind of proud of this is a little widget that I made that helps us understand or plot the time that

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,550
functions take to execute and get a general graph a chart that shows us a trend.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,480
So there's only seven of them in here and we're going to focus on the first two add up to first.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,980
I had to give them unique names before they were both called to add up to but add up to first uses the

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,030
loop add up to second uses that little shortcut.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,530
See if it's that big enough to see.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,520
And so we select one of them.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,920
Then I can specify a value for N and hit plot and then change and.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,380
And what I'll do is increase and then we'll see some sort of chart that shows what happens as and grows

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:43,890
larger.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,790
And this is basically just done with a timer in the background.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,740
So click plot starts a timer it does the operation stops the timer and then plots it and then we do

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,700
it again and it connects the dots and builds a little graph.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,870
So what I want to show you is that if we take this first one out up to second which was the one that

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,750
was faster we already know it's faster.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,680
But what we talked about in the last video is that there are three operations three things that take

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
time and think about it that way.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,730
The other one there was a lot of things that take time but this there's three and there's always three

20
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,540
things that take time.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,070
No matter what end is if it's ten or a billion.

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,780
So I'm going to plug in a number for her and like 100 and I'm going to hit plot and it's going to time

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:24,860
it.

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,640
So what is plotting for us here is not the number of operations because that's always three it's plotting

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,720
the time.

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,730
OK.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,190
So we only have one value so it doesn't really mean much.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,460
Let's add in 1000 There we go.

29
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,510
Let's add in 10000.

30
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,990
OK so it does seem like this is an extreme slope all of a sudden but just hang in there because we pop

31
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,720
back up and if we look at the difference here it's a matter of what are we talking about is these.

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,850
Remember these are nanoseconds with that little symbol means it's a very small fraction of a second.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,680
So it looks like this chart is all over the place and it is on such a small scale.

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,460
But what I want to show you is that we don't really care about that.

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,520
We care about a general trend and when we switch over to add up to first I'm going to do the same thing.

36
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,100
But I'm going to start again with one hundred.

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,350
So we're going out of the first 100.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,350
And remember that in this case unlike Adams's second well it was a constant number of operations and

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,510
up to first the number of operations depends on and because of this loop.

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,280
So if we start with 100 OK you can already see that it's definitely slower.

41
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,960
Let's go to 1000 All right it definitely looks slower again.

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,550
Ten thousand keep going here.

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,390
Keep adding in

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,030
going to keep going so that we can get a generalized trend.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,210
OK.

46
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,320
In the classroom took a little bit and the next one will take a couple of seconds.

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm not going to do it.

48
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,180
But what we can see here is that there's a pretty good line that's pretty easy to follow.

49
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,900
And as n grows larger which is down here the time grows in proportion which we kind of discussed in

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,310
the last video although we were talking about the number of operations but this is actually the time

51
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,620
being printed here.

52
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,910
And you can see that it follows what we were talking about.

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,000
It's not perfect but overall it's pretty close.

54
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:37,220
And same thing down here where we said that for add up to second it's always three operations.

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,080
It's the same number of operations no matter what end is.

56
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,920
So the time is pretty constant.

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,460
It fluctuated as you saw when we were working on such a small scale.

58
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,510
It did go up and down but overall when you're comparing the two this is significantly better.

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,210
And if I run this last one here I mean take a look at that and grows the time doesn't really change.

60
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,460
Now if we zoomed in it would be slightly different but it doesn't matter because this is a massive difference

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,600
1.2 seconds versus a couple of milliseconds.

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,840
So we'll be revisiting this tool to talk about some of these others as we go.

63
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:19,490
But here are first to generalize trends where we're comparing two algorithms that do the same thing

64
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,090
and you can see that they have vastly different big picture overviews of their performance.
