1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,320
Everyone will come back.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,540
This is going to be a really quick section.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,530
I just want to take what we just learned talking about Big-O notation.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,230
Time and space complexity analyzing code performance take that content and apply it to the stuff we

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:13,960
already know.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,380
So before we get to the advanced algorithms and sorting and crazy data structures let's just talk about

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,470
what we get for free.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,210
The basics in javascript so things like arrays and objects built in methods loops.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,200
How do they perform.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,170
What are the easy things the fast things we can do to an array.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,190
What's the method that might be slower than you would expect.

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,380
That's what we're going to talk about and it's going to be really quick.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,560
Again I'm not going to teach these things from scratch not showing how an array works or what it is.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,580
We're just going to talk about how it performs.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,550
So first our objectives understand how objects and arrays work through the lens of big-O.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,530
So various operations.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,910
Is there a fast way to insert to an array or slow way that sort of thing.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,490
Explain why up spoiler explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly gave it away

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,230
and we'll talk about why that is and how it works and if there are alternatives or if there's a better

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,550
way of inserting and then we'll compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects but also they're

21
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,560
built in methods.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,340
There's a lot of these methods we get for free.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,390
Like the built in javascript sort for an array for each object that keys object has own property.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,090
All that stuff we're going to discuss but it's going to be quick and this isn't I should sit out and

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,770
say this isn't a something you need to memorize it's not something that you know you need to refer to

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,860
the slides.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,410
I just want to give you a chance to take what we've learned about big-O and apply it to something tangible.

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,990
Before we dive into these crazier algorithms.

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,200
All right.

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,030
So let's start first we're going to discuss objects.

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,060
It will be nice and quick.

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,890
So don't go anywhere.

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,720
I'll see in the next video.
