WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:00.460
It there.

00:00.480 --> 00:01.400
Welcome back.

00:01.410 --> 00:07.560
So this section as well as the next section they're really one massive section but a split in half just

00:07.560 --> 00:09.990
so I don't end up with this one behemoth section.

00:09.990 --> 00:16.290
But both of them have to do with algorithms and problem solving patterns or strategies game plans approaches

00:16.290 --> 00:17.490
whatever you want to call it.

00:17.490 --> 00:22.590
Basically you're faced with a tough challenge some code a problem you have to solve and you don't know

00:22.590 --> 00:24.350
how to do it right off the bat.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.790
What are the steps you can take to make it solvable.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.580
And it really falls into two categories.

00:28.650 --> 00:34.550
This first section is more about the basic approach to solving a problem you don't know how to solve.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.570
Steps you can take things you can do to make it easier.

00:37.680 --> 00:43.590
And then the second section that comes after this is about specific blueprints or archetypes little

00:43.590 --> 00:48.980
strategies you can keep in your back pocket that help solve a lot of problems so it's more code specific

00:48.990 --> 00:49.950
in the next section.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.550
But both are equally important.

00:51.810 --> 00:57.570
But first objectives really quickly we're going to start by defining what an algorithm is in like 10

00:57.570 --> 00:58.580
seconds.

00:58.590 --> 01:04.110
Devise a plan to solve algorithms and then compare and contrast problem solving patterns including things

01:04.110 --> 01:07.550
like frequency counters to pointer problems and divide and conquer.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.660
So that's coming up in the next section.

01:09.690 --> 01:15.630
Like I said this section is really more focused on devising a plan sort of an approach to solving problems

01:15.720 --> 01:19.720
and then afterwards we'll dive into specific named patterns.

01:20.090 --> 01:23.080
OK quickly what is an algorithm.

01:23.190 --> 01:28.210
Well in today's world it's like the trendiest of the trendy buzzwords.

01:28.350 --> 01:33.750
I was watching an ad the other day for was on Instagram and there was an electric toothbrush and they

01:33.750 --> 01:38.930
were advertising you know this finely tuned algorithm for the vibrations and the toothbrush.

01:39.020 --> 01:42.160
It's a word that you can't escape.

01:42.450 --> 01:49.230
Really it just means a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task rather underwhelming definition.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.730
But that's all that it is.

01:50.730 --> 01:55.740
So when we say algorithm I mean we could be talking about you know a set of mathematical steps that

01:55.740 --> 01:57.560
we need to do to solve a problem.

01:57.630 --> 02:03.000
We could be talking about Facebook's algorithm that you know suggests certain ads to you or Google's

02:03.000 --> 02:08.700
algorithm when you search for something where it's a matter of you know 50 developers working together.

02:08.730 --> 02:14.160
It's probably vastly underestimating it maybe 100 developers who are working on search result algorithms

02:14.640 --> 02:16.920
over you know 10 plus years.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.300
So it really runs the gamut.

02:18.310 --> 02:22.670
But at its core it's just a set of steps to accomplish a task.

02:22.710 --> 02:27.720
So that could be something simple like you know calculate the first 100 prime numbers.

02:27.930 --> 02:34.740
There's many ways of doing that or it could be something like you know Instagram's algorithm that used

02:34.740 --> 02:39.070
to just show you results in chronological order and then they decided to change it.

02:39.150 --> 02:42.750
And now you miss a million posts by your friends anyway.

02:43.170 --> 02:44.270
Why do you need to know this.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.560
Well hopefully this is sort of clear already.

02:48.120 --> 02:53.040
Almost everything that you do in programming involves some sort of algorithm whether it's super basic

02:53.040 --> 02:56.520
things that you're doing your or you're building a complex application.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.730
You have to make these decisions you have to come up with a way of solving problems.

03:00.750 --> 03:06.030
So this stuff is super important but I do want to sort of constrict our definition of algorithm for

03:06.030 --> 03:06.670
now.

03:06.870 --> 03:13.320
We're not going to learn how to you know solve Instagram timeline algorithm.

03:13.390 --> 03:20.880
We're focusing on really a much narrower category and that is things that come up in interviews.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.390
So this is probably why a lot of you are taking this course.

03:24.510 --> 03:30.710
Yes this stuff is good to know especially this section applies to a lot of programming pretty much everything.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.650
But it also really applies to interview settings.

03:33.750 --> 03:38.730
Being able to you know sit in a office somewhere you've never been an answer tough questions or solve

03:38.730 --> 03:40.240
a problem you've never seen before.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.790
So just to reiterate this stuff comes up all the time in interviews.

03:45.260 --> 03:50.050
Oh boy how many of these do get interviews every go.

03:50.370 --> 03:53.210
So how do you get better at this stuff.

03:53.210 --> 03:58.340
You know a lot of people think this is just inherently people or good or bad at it.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.210
And I've seen that a lot when I'm teaching some.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.870
Some people are just naturally better at solving problems.

04:03.870 --> 04:10.950
I would say or they're more find their brain works right out of the box solving problems but that doesn't

04:10.950 --> 04:12.900
mean that it's hopeless for people who struggle.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.910
I've seen it many many times in my classes.

04:15.030 --> 04:19.740
During our interview weeks towards the end where we're doing computer science and sort of what this

04:19.740 --> 04:23.710
course is based off with some people pick it up much faster.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.970
Other people have to work towards that just like anything in life honestly.

04:26.970 --> 04:32.430
But I've seen many people turn it around and struggled during our first mock interview and have a panic

04:32.430 --> 04:37.640
attack basically in the middle of our you know conference room and then a week or two later.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.440
Brand new problem they've never seen before.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.590
Equally as difficult.

04:40.680 --> 04:45.540
They're able to sit there calmly and solve it using some of the steps I lay out here.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.460
So how do you improve.

04:47.730 --> 04:51.470
There's two things have already mentioned this first devise a plan for solving problems.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.630
So this is more of a non-technical.

04:53.670 --> 04:58.290
It still is technical but it's more about how do you approach the problem strategies for breaking it

04:58.290 --> 04:58.890
down.

04:58.890 --> 05:04.490
There's a couple of steps that I read it and then afterwards master common problem solving patterns.

05:04.570 --> 05:10.570
So a lot of algorithms especially in interviews a lot of these problems that come up can be broken into

05:10.630 --> 05:12.050
sort of different categories.

05:12.310 --> 05:17.620
And if you can identify some of those categories there are some steps you can take in your code.

05:17.680 --> 05:23.130
Some recipes you can keep that you can pull out and that will help you solve the algorithm or the challenge.

05:23.140 --> 05:26.780
We're starting off with this first one problem solving strategies.

05:26.830 --> 05:33.130
So this section is focused on a simple foolproof magical miraculous failsafe approach to solving every

05:33.130 --> 05:38.260
problem ever which can be yours for only two payments of nine hundred ninety nine dollars ninety nine

05:38.260 --> 05:38.980
cents.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.190
Call now.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.170
No not really.

05:41.170 --> 05:44.730
This is not at all what the section is about.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.800
This is just laying down a set of steps that can help you.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.110
But of course it is not going to solve the problem for you.

05:50.110 --> 05:55.330
It's not foolproof but I've seen many people like you already mentioned turned their problem solving

05:55.330 --> 06:00.010
approaches around many people who have gone from feeling really apprehensive about solving new problems

06:00.370 --> 06:07.000
and lock up in the middle of an interview setting and giving them sort of a game plan a set of steps

06:07.150 --> 06:11.270
that you can keep in your mind it's a concrete thing to refer back to.

06:11.410 --> 06:12.860
Step by step what you should do.

06:13.090 --> 06:18.130
And I've seen it help a lot of people so it's not miraculous it's not magical or foolproof but still

06:18.130 --> 06:19.390
is pretty helpful.

06:19.390 --> 06:20.800
So what are those steps.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.280
Well first understand the problem.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.750
So each of these bullet points will get its own video.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.220
Understand the problem.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.530
Explore concrete examples.

06:29.530 --> 06:30.850
Break it down.

06:31.060 --> 06:36.680
Solve slash simplify the problem and then look back and refactor.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.140
So these are the different videos we're going to have in this section.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.900
Each of these points there's a lot more behind it and it's all.

06:43.910 --> 06:46.010
Each one is part of this plan.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.400
This game plan this recipe for solving a challenge or a problem.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.710
So that's where we're going here.

06:50.770 --> 06:55.070
And then the next section is on more concrete archetypes for algorithms.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.260
But we're starting here.

06:56.260 --> 06:56.580
All right.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.490
So problem solving hopefully.

06:58.570 --> 06:59.800
You know why this is important.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.420
Don't make me go back to this slide.

07:01.430 --> 07:03.960
It's too many button presses interviews.

07:04.030 --> 07:04.680
Yeah.

07:04.930 --> 07:05.610
Great stuff.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.250
OK.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.050
Let's get started in the next video.
