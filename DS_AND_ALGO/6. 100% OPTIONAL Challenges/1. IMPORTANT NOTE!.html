<p>Hello! </p><p>This section consists of a few practice problems that make use of the code patterns from the previous section.  These can get tricky, so I want to be clear that they are 100% optional. In my in-person bootcamps, I treat these questions as extra-credit/bonus challenges.  DO NOT LET THESE CHALLENGES PREVENT YOU FROM MOVING ON!!!</p>
