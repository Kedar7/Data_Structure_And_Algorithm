00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,610
Everyone in this video to talk about the order of the content is arranged in.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,420
So we've established that there is a lot of stuff here and it's pretty varied.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,460
You don't have to go through every single video one after the other like you might with the intro to

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,340
C S S course or intro to J.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:22,350
Yes some of you might be here only for the sorting algorithm stuff or only the data structures and that's

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,880
totally fine.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,360
You do not need to go through everything in order.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,410
But however you do it please take your time.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,330
This content can be a little dense.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,770
There's a lot of it here.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,270
Remember that this is the condensed version of what I teach over two and a half three weeks of in-person

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,600
courses in a boot camp where it's five days a week eight to 10 hours a day.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,820
It's very intense content and this is three weeks of that.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,910
So even though it might it's only 20 something hours remember that that's just the amount of lecture.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,580
There's a lot of time to digest that and understand it do the quizzes build stuff etc..

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,340
So onto the important piece which is please notice the prerequisite lectures in every section.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,590
After the first section and the next section every other section contains at the very beginning a lecture

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:19,830
may just show you here called prerequisites in all caps and all that it contains is information about

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,050
which other sections you need to complete.

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,040
First before you can tackle this one.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,080
So if you do want to jump to sorting algorithms for example I'd say you want to go to a bubble sort.

22
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,230
Well all that you really need to know.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,500
According to this is Big O notation.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,780
Section 1 if you want to jump to a more complex sorting algorithm like merge sort.

25
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,720
You definitely need to know Big-O notation and Section 6 which covers recursion because merge sort the

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,890
way we implement it is with a recursive implementation.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,750
And then there are some secondary considerations.

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,930
These are the sections I recommend you check out but you don't have to.

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,830
So the first to hear Section 1 in section 6.

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,160
You definitely need to understand these are just helpful and you can see as we go later in the course

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,410
like we look at binary search trees.

32
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,280
Same thing.

33
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,220
The prerequisites that you definitely need to understand and then things that could be helpful while

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,550
not could be things that will be helpful but they're not mandatory.

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,040
So please pay attention to that.

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,070
Every section has prerequisites.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,440
A text lecture at the beginning.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,710
It's there for a reason.

39
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,410
If you do hop around if you don't want to go through every single section in order make sure you're

40
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,810
paying attention to that so that you don't get confused when I talk about binary heaps and priority

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,990
queues in the dextrous shortest path section which if we go to that section you can see here we are.

42
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,320
You can see you need to have binary heaps and priority queues.

43
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,060
Anyway I'll leave it at that.

44
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,110
Just please notice those prerequisites lectures are very helpful.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,040
If you do want to hop around Otherwise you can just go to the content in order.

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,340
Get.
