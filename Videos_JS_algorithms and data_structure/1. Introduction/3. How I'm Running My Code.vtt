00:00.210 --> 00:01.110
Welcome back.

00:01.110 --> 00:04.050
In this video I want to address my developer environment.

00:04.050 --> 00:07.120
I'm keeping things really really simple for this course.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.170
I'm not even having I'm not downloading any software.

00:10.230 --> 00:11.820
I'm doing everything in the browser.

00:11.910 --> 00:15.170
That doesn't mean that you need to do that at this point.

00:15.180 --> 00:19.430
The only requirement for the course is that you know the basic syntax javascript.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.200
You know that you're comfortable writing J.S. code.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.240
So however you do that up until now.

00:24.330 --> 00:28.740
I would just do that continue on but I want to show you what I'm going to do if you do want to follow

00:28.740 --> 00:29.330
along.

00:29.370 --> 00:31.170
So I'm using Chrome as my browser.

00:31.170 --> 00:36.870
I always do in all my courses and chrome comes with a little developer tool called snippets javascript

00:36.870 --> 00:38.010
snippets.

00:38.010 --> 00:42.450
So here's chrome and I just open up the con..

00:42.810 --> 00:49.170
I usually use a shortcut on a Mac it's command shift or no it command option J but you can also go to

00:49.170 --> 00:56.760
inspect and then that takes you to the elements and you can go over to the sources tab and then in the

00:56.760 --> 01:00.810
sources tab there's a snippets sub tab I guess you would call it.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.760
There's a couple of them but I have snippets as the only thing that shows and you can see I have a bunch

01:05.760 --> 01:11.430
of names snippets I've I'm recording this after I finished writing and recording the rest of the course.

01:11.580 --> 01:14.940
So you can see for example here's one of our snippets.

01:14.940 --> 01:19.710
So I'm just doing everything in the browser here rather than using the terminal and running code with

01:19.710 --> 01:20.520
no G-S.

01:20.550 --> 01:22.080
You absolutely could do that.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.970
You could write your code and Sublime Text.

01:23.970 --> 01:24.720
You could use.

01:24.750 --> 01:29.820
I think there's equivalents to snippets and other browsers you could use Jay Espen code pen there's

01:29.820 --> 01:34.570
many options out there just run javascript but to show you how this works.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.680
Let's say I'm going to make a new empty snippet.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.700
You've seen me do this a couple of times in the course.

01:39.720 --> 01:48.060
I'll just call this demo snippet and then in here close that I'll make it a little larger and then just

01:48.060 --> 01:52.950
do some really simple thing like concept about log Hello from.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.660
From this snippet.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.050
Oh my gosh can not spell here.

01:57.410 --> 01:57.850
OK.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.850
So let's leave it at that.

01:59.970 --> 02:06.250
And all I have to do is to execute this code is either go down here and click play.

02:06.420 --> 02:13.290
But also it shows me the shortcut command return on a Mac and on the PC will tell you whatever the respective

02:13.290 --> 02:14.400
equivalent is.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.660
So when I hit that I'm going to do it right now if I scroll up I should see.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.160
There we go.

02:19.230 --> 02:20.760
Hello from the snippet.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.980
So you'll see me do this throughout the course.

02:23.010 --> 02:29.580
For example I might run this snippet here and it doesn't matter what it does it's a binary search tree

02:29.610 --> 02:33.280
breath first search hit command enter.

02:33.450 --> 02:34.200
It just ran.

02:34.230 --> 02:35.580
And you can see this is the output.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.140
This is what was returned.

02:37.770 --> 02:39.630
And that's pretty much all I have to say about Crumb's.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.530
Tippett So you'll see me work with them frequently.

02:42.550 --> 02:44.280
I just have a bunch of them over here.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.890
I usually make a new one for each thing so here's a double length list.

02:48.900 --> 02:56.030
We add a set method and then I'll make a new one when we add a remove method for example.

02:56.130 --> 02:57.660
But that's all I'll say for now.

02:57.660 --> 03:01.880
It's a very easy way for me to run code in the browser that everyone can do.

03:01.980 --> 03:07.260
You don't have to download anything that's not Mac or PC specific but also if you know how to write

03:07.260 --> 03:11.370
javascript which I hope you do to take this course should know the basics.

03:11.370 --> 03:14.520
You might just want to continue on with whatever you're most comfortable with.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.820
This is not a requirement for the course.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.610
We're writing basic javascript.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.850
Run it however you prefer.

03:21.030 --> 03:21.470
OK.
