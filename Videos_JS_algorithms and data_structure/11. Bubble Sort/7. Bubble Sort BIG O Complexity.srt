00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,960
What is the time complexity of bubble sort.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:10,170
Well in general it's squared because we have a nested loop and we're roughly making a comparison for

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,540
each item in that array.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,160
We are making an number of comparisons in order to get 8 to the end.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,700
We had to compare eight to every single other item in the array.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,880
However if the data is nearly sorted or already sorted then with this new version with no swaps it's

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,580
more like linear time that's the best case possible.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,250
And there's eight items we go through.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,620
I mean technically in our example it was to N because we went through the first time and then we went

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,610
through again to make sure nothing was swapped.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,260
And then we broke out of the loop.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,100
So but that rounded down shouldn't say round but simplifies down to 0 of end.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,590
So that's the best case but that doesn't mean that we should be using bubble sort in.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,840
You do know that your data is very nearly sorted.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,480
It's a good candidate.

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,430
Possibly also see another good candidate in a little bit.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,830
This is more just to show an optimization this is a classic optimization to make.

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,910
And yeah I think this video here.

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,000
So we have this version which doesn't use the fancy swopped syntax.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,070
Then we have this version that does using light as well as the east 20:15 syntax and then down here

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,510
we have a version Murray added that no swaps variable in to short circuit.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,290
If we don't make any swaps that is bubble sort.

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,510
It's a lot I know.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,930
Now we have another sorting algorithm coming up next.
