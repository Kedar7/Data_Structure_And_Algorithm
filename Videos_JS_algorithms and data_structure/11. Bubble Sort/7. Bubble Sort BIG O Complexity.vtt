00:00.240 --> 00:02.960
What is the time complexity of bubble sort.

00:03.210 --> 00:10.170
Well in general it's squared because we have a nested loop and we're roughly making a comparison for

00:10.170 --> 00:11.540
each item in that array.

00:11.630 --> 00:16.160
We are making an number of comparisons in order to get 8 to the end.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.700
We had to compare eight to every single other item in the array.

00:19.710 --> 00:26.880
However if the data is nearly sorted or already sorted then with this new version with no swaps it's

00:26.940 --> 00:29.580
more like linear time that's the best case possible.

00:29.610 --> 00:32.250
And there's eight items we go through.

00:32.250 --> 00:37.620
I mean technically in our example it was to N because we went through the first time and then we went

00:37.620 --> 00:39.610
through again to make sure nothing was swapped.

00:39.630 --> 00:41.260
And then we broke out of the loop.

00:41.310 --> 00:47.100
So but that rounded down shouldn't say round but simplifies down to 0 of end.

00:47.310 --> 00:52.590
So that's the best case but that doesn't mean that we should be using bubble sort in.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.840
You do know that your data is very nearly sorted.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.480
It's a good candidate.

00:56.710 --> 00:59.430
Possibly also see another good candidate in a little bit.

00:59.450 --> 01:03.830
This is more just to show an optimization this is a classic optimization to make.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.910
And yeah I think this video here.

01:05.910 --> 01:10.000
So we have this version which doesn't use the fancy swopped syntax.

01:10.240 --> 01:17.070
Then we have this version that does using light as well as the east 20:15 syntax and then down here

01:17.130 --> 01:21.510
we have a version Murray added that no swaps variable in to short circuit.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.290
If we don't make any swaps that is bubble sort.

01:24.410 --> 01:25.510
It's a lot I know.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.930
Now we have another sorting algorithm coming up next.
