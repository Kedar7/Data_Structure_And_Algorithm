00:00.170 --> 00:03.310
OK so this will be really quick video but I want to show something.

00:03.360 --> 00:09.930
I'm kind of proud of this is a little widget that I made that helps us understand or plot the time that

00:09.930 --> 00:15.550
functions take to execute and get a general graph a chart that shows us a trend.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.480
So there's only seven of them in here and we're going to focus on the first two add up to first.

00:20.610 --> 00:25.980
I had to give them unique names before they were both called to add up to but add up to first uses the

00:25.980 --> 00:29.030
loop add up to second uses that little shortcut.

00:29.220 --> 00:31.530
See if it's that big enough to see.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.520
And so we select one of them.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.920
Then I can specify a value for N and hit plot and then change and.

00:38.070 --> 00:43.380
And what I'll do is increase and then we'll see some sort of chart that shows what happens as and grows

00:43.380 --> 00:43.890
larger.

00:44.010 --> 00:46.790
And this is basically just done with a timer in the background.

00:46.840 --> 00:52.740
So click plot starts a timer it does the operation stops the timer and then plots it and then we do

00:52.740 --> 00:55.700
it again and it connects the dots and builds a little graph.

00:55.710 --> 01:00.870
So what I want to show you is that if we take this first one out up to second which was the one that

01:00.870 --> 01:02.750
was faster we already know it's faster.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.680
But what we talked about in the last video is that there are three operations three things that take

01:07.680 --> 01:09.240
time and think about it that way.

01:09.270 --> 01:14.730
The other one there was a lot of things that take time but this there's three and there's always three

01:14.730 --> 01:15.540
things that take time.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.070
No matter what end is if it's ten or a billion.

01:18.210 --> 01:24.780
So I'm going to plug in a number for her and like 100 and I'm going to hit plot and it's going to time

01:24.780 --> 01:24.860
it.

01:24.870 --> 01:29.640
So what is plotting for us here is not the number of operations because that's always three it's plotting

01:29.640 --> 01:30.720
the time.

01:31.250 --> 01:31.730
OK.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.190
So we only have one value so it doesn't really mean much.

01:34.230 --> 01:38.460
Let's add in 1000 There we go.

01:38.670 --> 01:41.510
Let's add in 10000.

01:41.550 --> 01:48.990
OK so it does seem like this is an extreme slope all of a sudden but just hang in there because we pop

01:48.990 --> 01:54.720
back up and if we look at the difference here it's a matter of what are we talking about is these.

01:54.750 --> 01:59.850
Remember these are nanoseconds with that little symbol means it's a very small fraction of a second.

01:59.880 --> 02:05.680
So it looks like this chart is all over the place and it is on such a small scale.

02:06.060 --> 02:09.460
But what I want to show you is that we don't really care about that.

02:09.690 --> 02:16.520
We care about a general trend and when we switch over to add up to first I'm going to do the same thing.

02:16.950 --> 02:19.100
But I'm going to start again with one hundred.

02:19.620 --> 02:21.350
So we're going out of the first 100.

02:21.780 --> 02:28.350
And remember that in this case unlike Adams's second well it was a constant number of operations and

02:28.440 --> 02:34.510
up to first the number of operations depends on and because of this loop.

02:35.100 --> 02:40.280
So if we start with 100 OK you can already see that it's definitely slower.

02:40.510 --> 02:44.960
Let's go to 1000 All right it definitely looks slower again.

02:45.370 --> 02:49.550
Ten thousand keep going here.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.390
Keep adding in

02:53.820 --> 02:58.030
going to keep going so that we can get a generalized trend.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.210
OK.

03:00.250 --> 03:03.320
In the classroom took a little bit and the next one will take a couple of seconds.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.280
I'm not going to do it.

03:04.670 --> 03:11.180
But what we can see here is that there's a pretty good line that's pretty easy to follow.

03:11.630 --> 03:17.900
And as n grows larger which is down here the time grows in proportion which we kind of discussed in

03:17.900 --> 03:22.310
the last video although we were talking about the number of operations but this is actually the time

03:22.310 --> 03:23.620
being printed here.

03:23.630 --> 03:25.910
And you can see that it follows what we were talking about.

03:25.940 --> 03:30.000
It's not perfect but overall it's pretty close.

03:30.350 --> 03:37.220
And same thing down here where we said that for add up to second it's always three operations.

03:37.220 --> 03:40.080
It's the same number of operations no matter what end is.

03:40.130 --> 03:42.920
So the time is pretty constant.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.460
It fluctuated as you saw when we were working on such a small scale.

03:46.460 --> 03:52.510
It did go up and down but overall when you're comparing the two this is significantly better.

03:52.560 --> 03:59.210
And if I run this last one here I mean take a look at that and grows the time doesn't really change.

03:59.210 --> 04:04.460
Now if we zoomed in it would be slightly different but it doesn't matter because this is a massive difference

04:04.500 --> 04:08.600
1.2 seconds versus a couple of milliseconds.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.840
So we'll be revisiting this tool to talk about some of these others as we go.

04:13.130 --> 04:19.490
But here are first to generalize trends where we're comparing two algorithms that do the same thing

04:20.030 --> 04:25.090
and you can see that they have vastly different big picture overviews of their performance.
